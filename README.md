Create the following diagrams in StarUML:

Use Case Diagram

Class Diagram

Activity Diagram

Package Diagram

Communication Diagram

Sequence Diagram

1 . The patient books and confirms an appointment with the receptionist.

2 . After registration, the patient undergoes check-ups and tests.

3 . A prescription is written based on the diagnosis.

4 . The system checks if the prescribed medicine is available.
